<p>Could this be Earth? Could this be light?
  <br/>
  <p>Does this mean everything, is going to be alright?
    <br/>
    <p>One look out my window there's trees talking like people.
      <br/>
      <p>I dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
        <br/>
        <p>I've dreamt of gravity, keeping us around.
          <br/>
          <p>I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and it was silent.
            <br/>
            <p>What is this love? I don't feel the same
              <br/>
              <p>Don't believe what this is, could be given a name.
                <br/>
                <p>I woke you were there, tracing planets on my forehead.
                  <br/>
                  <p>But I forget 23 like I forget 17
                    <br/>
                    <p>And I'll forget my first love, like you'll forget a daydream.
                      <br/>
                      <p>And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
                        <br/>
                        <p>We'll all fade to grey soon, on the TV station.</p>
