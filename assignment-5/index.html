    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>Giving in is anything I'd provide<br />
My figure surrounded<br />
The riches are clouded<br />
If you live like I live<br />
I wouldn't live without it<br />
Said I'd be your new best friend, didn't I?<br />
If February, anything I'd provide<br />
When you coming down here<br />
You're shaded, I provided all that<br />
Rain coming down<br />
Ambition got providing<br />
All that money mine</p>

<p>Memo finna start acting out if I don't see him soon<br />
Yeah my best friend ain't backing out, it's still on sight, fool<br />
I'm the only one out here on the night loops<br />
I'm the only one out here on the night loops<br />
Trophy case still light, body need a race stripe<br />
And these minerals on my body break light<br />
And these reds on my body brakelight<br />
New man comin' up ahead on his own two<br />
Is you a natural blondie like Goku?<br />
Sleepin' on my belly in a loop like a serpent<br />
Talking Heads ripplin' on the surface</p>

<p>Eyes low, chin heavy, shoegazer<br />
Moonwalkin', R.I.P. Stanley Kubrick<br />
You had you some birthdays, could you prove it?<br />
Show me the wisdom in your movement<br />
Show me some wisdom in your movement<br />
Feelings you provide<br />
Feelings you provide<br />
I know it, I know it<br />
The feelings I, the feelings, I know it, I<br />
Feelings you provide<br />
Feelings you provide<br />
I know it, I know it<br />
The feelings, I know it, the feelings, I, I<br />
Tonight I might change my life<br />
If you lived like I live<br />
You couldn't live without it<br />
Said I'd be your new best friend<br />
But what more? Yeah<br />
Ain't too late to out<br />
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ahhh<br />
Provide, provide<br />
Pro...<br />
Ooh, oooh, oooh<br />
Tonight I might change my life, all for you<br />
All for you (Provide)</p>

<p>Provided, diamond lane that didn't exist<br />
Packed the Astro van and brought my kids through<br />
Prada tee on the eldest, throw the Gildan on the children<br />
Hand-me-down fits<br />
Chest pass, see mist off rotation (Swish, swisha)<br />
Stiff smile just like I'm Aphex Twin (Yeah, come to daddy, yeah)<br />
Pat the Patagonia pockets, tryna find my zip (uh, where it's at? Yeah)<br />
Blunt twist, tightropes, I'm not fallin' off (never that, no)<br />
Watch friends, go pro through fisheye lens, drownin' off clear<br />
I just saw JAWS, divin' under influence<br />
Been feelin' like the Lord just out of reach for me (for me)<br />
How I feel lettin' man speak<br />
How I feel lettin' man speak for me (for me)<br />
Holyfield, keep your ears split for me<br />
Can't show my face if you spit for me<br />
Spit for me, yeah</p>

<p>Eyes low, chin heavy shoegazer<br />
Moonwalkin', R.I.P. Stanley Kubrick<br />
You had you some birthdays, could you prove it?<br />
Show me the wisdom in your movement<br />
Show me some wisdom in your movement<br />
Feelings you provide<br />
Feelings you provide<br />
I know, I know it<br />
The feelings I, the feelings, I know it, I<br />
Feelings you provide<br />
Feelings you provide<br />
I know it, I know it<br />
The feelings, I know it, the feelings, I, I<br />
Tonight I might change my life, all for you, all for you<br />
Provide</p>
