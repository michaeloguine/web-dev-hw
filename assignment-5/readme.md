<p>A div is a block level HTML element. It's purpose is to divide other tags into groups that make sense. A span is an inline element that is used to to group a set of inline elements. You can use span to hook text that you want to style differently. ID is used to label sections of your html. Class specifies one or more classnames for an element. It's used to point to a class in a style sheet.</p>
