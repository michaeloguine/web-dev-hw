<h1>Assignment 6 Technical Report<h2>

<p>I researched some popular colors from the 90s. I decided to go with the classic Nickelodeon logo and added another retro image that I thought looked cool. I styled it by choosing colors that truly fit the 90s theme.</p>

My color palette was orange, yellow, indigo, and purple.

My work cycle started with me adding the head elements and then choosing a style. I used selector types and selector chains to further style. I changed the opacity of a few elements.
