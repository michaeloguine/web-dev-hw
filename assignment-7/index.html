    SCENE I. Venice. A street.

      <p><i>Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO</i></p>
<div class="speaking">
  <p>ANTONIO</p>

        <p>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:<br />
        It wearies me; you say it wearies you;<br />
        But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,<br />
        What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,<br />
        I am to learn;<br />
        And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,<br />
        That I have much ado to know myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="speaking">
  <p>SALARINO</p>

    <p>
      Your mind is tossing on the ocean;<br />
      There, where your argosies with portly sail,<br />
      Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,<br />
      Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,<br />
      Do overpeer the petty traffickers,<br />
      That curtsy to them, do them reverence,<br />
      As they fly by them with their woven wings.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="speaking">
  <p>SALANIO</p>

      <p>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,<br />
      The better part of my affections would<br />
      Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still<br />
      Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,<br />
      Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;<br />
      And every object that might make me fear<br />
      Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt<br />
      Would make me sad.
</p>
</div>
<div class="speaking">
  <p>SALARINO</p>

      My wind cooling my broth<br />
      Would blow me to an ague, when I thought<br />
      What harm a wind too great at sea might do.<br />
      I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,<br />
      But I should think of shallows and of flats,<br />
      And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,<br />
      Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs<br />
      To kiss her burial. Should I go to church<br />
      And see the holy edifice of stone,<br />
      And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,<br />
      Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,<br />
      Would scatter all her spices on the stream,<br />
      Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,<br />
      And, in a word, but even now worth this,<br />
      And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought<br />
      To think on this, and shall I lack the thought<br />
      That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?<br />
      But tell not me; I know, Antonio<br />
      Is sad to think upon his merchandise.<br />
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="speaking">
    <p>ANTONIO</p>

        <p>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,<br />
        My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,<br />
        Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate<br />
        Upon the fortune of this present year:<br />
        Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.<br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="speaking">
        <p>SALARINO</p>

            <p>Why, then you are in love.<br />
            </p>
