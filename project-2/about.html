    <p>Hello everyone. My name is Michael Oguine. Thank you for taking the time to look at my site. I have put a lot of work into this. I am very inexpereinced with HTML and programming and writing in general, but I am doing my best. I have enjoyed this process. Hopefully one day I can design an extremely beautiful webpage. For now, I am proud of what I created.</p>
    <p>I decided to make this project about pasta because it is one of my favorite things to eat. I wanted to be able to share my recipe with the rest of the world. I know that some people may take a different approach to preparing their spaghetti bolognese, but this is my method. It has been tried and tested for years and it has never failed me. I'm not saying that those of you who are reading this will be able to make it turn out as good as mine, but there is a great chacne you will if you follow my instructions carefully. Please enjoy this video of Gordon Ramsay making bolognese sauce. I guarentee you mine is better.</p>
